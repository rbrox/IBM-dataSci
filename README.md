üìù **Sales Forecasting Project Statement**

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop a sales forecasting model for Favorita stores located in Ecuador. The task is to predict the sales for thousands of product families sold at these stores. The provided dataset contains historical sales data, store and product information, promotional data, as well as supplementary information like store metadata, oil prices, and holidays/events.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following files:

1. **train.csv**: This file contains time series data of sales and features such as store_nbr, family, and onpromotion. The target variable is the sales, representing the total sales for a product family at a particular store on a given date.

2. **test.csv**: Similar to the train.csv file, this file includes the same features, and the task is to predict the sales for the dates provided in this file.

3. **sample_submission.csv**: A sample submission file in the correct format.

4. **stores.csv**: This file provides metadata for the stores, including city, state, type, and cluster. The cluster variable represents a grouping of similar stores.

5. **oil.csv**: Daily oil prices are included in this file. The oil price information is available for both the train and test data timeframes. It's important to note that Ecuador's economy is highly dependent on oil prices.

6. **holidays_events.csv**: This file contains information about holidays and events, including metadata. Pay attention to the "transferred" column, as it indicates if a holiday was officially transferred to another date. Extra days added to a holiday are marked as "Bridge."

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to build a sales forecasting model that predicts the sales of product families at Favorita stores in Ecuador. Using the historical sales data, along with the provided features such as store information, promotional data, oil prices, and holidays/events, the model should accurately forecast the sales for the given test dates.

The sales forecasting model will assist Favorita in optimizing inventory management, planning promotions, and meeting customer demand effectively. Accurate sales predictions can help in making informed business decisions, ensuring optimal stock levels, and maximizing profitability.

## Additional Considerations
There are a few additional factors to keep in mind while tackling this project:

- Wages in the public sector are paid every two weeks on the 15th and the last day of the month. This payment pattern may impact supermarket sales.
- An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck Ecuador on April 16, 2016. The earthquake and subsequent relief efforts greatly affected supermarket sales for several weeks.

By developing an accurate sales forecasting model, we aim to provide Favorita with insights and predictions that enable them to plan and optimize their operations, anticipate demand fluctuations, and improve overall business performance.

# üìù **Installation Guide**

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the installation, make sure you have the following requirements met:

- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
- Git installed (if you prefer using Git commands). Get git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Basic knowledge of using the command line or terminal.

üêô **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
If you haven't already, start by cloning the repository using the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/rbrox/IBM-dataSci.git
```

üì• **Note**: If you don't have Git installed, you can download it separately for Windows from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and for macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by running `brew install git` in your terminal.

üñ•Ô∏è **Alternative**: If you prefer using a Git GUI client, you can download one such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), and then clone the repository through the graphical interface.

## üêç **Step 2: Setting Up the Virtual Environment**
To ensure a clean and isolated Python environment, it is recommended to use a virtual environment. Here's how to set up the virtual environment:

### For macOS and Linux:
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:
   ```shell
   cd IBM-dataSci
   ```

2. Create a new virtual environment called `venv`:
   ```shell
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```shell
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

### For Windows:
1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the project directory:
   ```shell
   cd IBM-dataSci
   ```

2. Create a new virtual environment called `venv`:
   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```shell
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

‚úÖ **Note**: If you prefer using a different virtual environment name, replace `venv` with your desired name.

## üì¶ **Step 3: Install Project Dependencies**
Now that you have the virtual environment set up, you can install the project dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Run the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

üöÄ **Step 4: Run the Project**
With the virtual environment activated and dependencies installed, you are ready to run the project. Execute the appropriate commands or scripts provided within the repository to start the project or follow any specific instructions mentioned in the repository's documentation.

üí° **Tip**: Make sure to consult the repository's README or documentation for any additional instructions or steps specific to the project.

Congratulations! You have successfully cloned the repository, set up the virtual environment, installed the project dependencies, and are ready to run the project. Enjoy exploring and working with the data science project!
